# Hi there, I'm [i0dev!](https://github.com/i0dev), but you can call me i0 ðŸ‘‹

### Here are my github stats, if you're ever so curious. I am just getting started out in the world of development, so hopefuly they get better over time! I'm looking to start using github for everything I do, making it my main source for uploading, sharing, and working on projects!


### I work solely in Java and SQL as of now, but I hope in the future to branch out and work on applications in: Python, Swift, JavaScript, and start diving into the C family!

### I am a Computer Science Major at the University Of Minnesota, looking to learn Network Administration as a side hustle.
